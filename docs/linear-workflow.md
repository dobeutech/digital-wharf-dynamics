# Linear Project Workflow

## Project Information

**Project Name**: DOBEU Digital Wharf Dynamics  
**Team**: Dobeu Tech Solutions (DTS)  
**Team ID**: `86871372-0278-407a-b88f-3232019b3327`

## Workflow Structure

### Stop Points & Update Process

At each stop point during development, the following should be updated in Linear:

1. **Create/Update Issues** for completed work
2. **Update Project Status** with current progress
3. **Document Changes** in issue descriptions
4. **Link Related Issues** when applicable

### Standard Workflow Steps

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create project in Linear
   - Break down work into issues
   - Assign priorities and estimates
   - Set up project milestones

2. **Development Phase**
   - Update issues as work progresses
   - Mark issues as "In Progress" when starting
   - Update descriptions with implementation details
   - Link related issues

3. **Stop Points** (Update Linear)
   - After completing a feature
   - After fixing a bug
   - After refactoring code
   - After updating documentation
   - Before committing to git

4. **Completion Phase**
   - Mark issues as "Done"
   - Update project status
   - Document lessons learned
   - Archive completed work

## Automation

The development workflow includes automatic Linear updates at stop points:

- After code changes
- Before commits
- After documentation updates
- After refactoring

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Issues Small**: Break large work into smaller, manageable issues
2. **Update Regularly**: Don't let issues go stale
3. **Link Related Work**: Use issue relationships
4. **Document Decisions**: Add context to issue descriptions
5. **Track Time**: Use estimates and track actual time when possible
