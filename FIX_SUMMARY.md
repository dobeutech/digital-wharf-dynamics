# Fix Summary - 2025-12-16

## 🚀 Issues Resolved

I have addressed the key outstanding issues identified in the checklist.

### 1. CCPA Admin Endpoints (Item 3)
**Status: ✅ Fixed**

- **Problem:** The CCPA admin page could not fetch or update requests because the backend endpoints were missing.
- **Solution:** Updated `netlify/functions/ccpa-request.ts` to support `GET` and `PATCH` methods.
- **Security:** Added strict `requireAuth` and `requirePermission("admin:access")` checks for these endpoints to ensure only admins can access them.
- **Changes:**
  - Added `processed_at` and `notes` fields to the request document structure.
  - Implemented `GET` logic to fetch all requests or filter by status.
  - Implemented `PATCH` logic to update status and notes.

### 2. Support Chat Button (Item 5)
**Status: ✅ Fixed**

- **Problem:** The "Open Support Chat" button on the Dashboard did nothing when clicked.
- **Solution:** Connected the button to the Intercom widget using `window.Intercom("show")`.
- **Implementation:** Updated `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` and added type definition for `window.Intercom` in `src/vite-env.d.ts` to maintain type safety.

### 3. Code Quality (Linting)
**Status: ✅ Verified**

- **Action:** Ran ESLint to verify changes.
- **Fix:** Resolved TypeScript `any` type error in `Dashboard.tsx` by properly defining the Window interface.
- **Result:** Codebase is clean of errors in modified files.

## 📝 Pending Items

The following items from the checklist remain open:

- **Dashboard Pending Purchases:** Currently shows 0. Requires full backend implementation for purchase tracking.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** 6 moderate vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (esbuild/vite). Requires breaking changes to fix (skipped for now to prevent regression).
- **Environment Variables:** Optional Supabase variables are not set (app works with MongoDB).
- **Documentation Index:** Minor documentation updates needed.

## 🧪 Verification

- **Lint:** Passed `npm run lint` (clean on modified files).
- **Types:** Verified with `src/vite-env.d.ts` update.

The application is ready for testing of the new CCPA admin features and the support chat button.
